    title: 'Integrative KnowGen: Integrative Knowledge Base Generation for Criminology as a Domain of Choice',
    publisher: 'ICDTA 2022: Digital Technologies and Applications (Springer)',
    date: 'May 2022',
    desc: 'We have proposed an architecture for automatic generation of knowledge bases from various heterogenous sources. Criminology has been chosen as a domain of choice because extensive knowledge in this area can help in curbing crimes in our society by creating preventive and predictive analysis systems. The model yields an average accuracy of 95.35% which surpasses the previous approaches.',

    date: 'Mar 2022',
    desc: 'RCNN-Crop is used to localize the pancreas by building bounding boxes and auto-crop the ROI obtained from various other organs in the abdominal CT scans. RCNN-Crop is inspired by the Region Proposal Network (RPN) and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) architectures of the Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) to auto-crop the pancreatic ROI by constructing bounding boxes around the desired region and has a Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 28.10% for the dataset provided.',
