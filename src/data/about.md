# Intro

I am a final year student at [University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Panjab University](https://www.uiet.pu.ac.in) pursuing my Bachelors of Engineering in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I have a keen interest in data science and software development. I am a self-taught programmer and I am always looking for new challenges to solve.

# Currently

I am working as a Research Intern at [Design Innovation Centre, University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Panjab University](https://dic.puchd.ac.in/). I am working on a project to improve image segmentation in various medical imaging modalities using deep learning for successful diagnosis of tumors. I use an a array of tech including [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).

# Some history

- I started to learn programming in 2019, when I was in the first year of my Bachelors of Engineering. I started with c and c++ and then moved to python.

- Learnt about various development domains in 2019. I started with web development, worked on various web technologies like Django, Flask, React, and then moved to mobile development.

- In the same year I joined Programming Club of UIET, [PClub](https://pclubuiet.in/) as a member. Here I learnt about data science, software development, and machine learning. Now, I am the acting convener of the club for the 2021-22 academic year. Here we conduct various workshops and competitions to improve technical skills at our campus.

- In 2020 I started working as a full-stack developer at [Upepo](https://www.upepo.in/) as a part of the core developement team. Here I worked with flutter, dart, python, and react. Developed the MVP application for the company which has 500+ daily active users.

- Meanwhile I was learning about data science and artificial intelligence. Learned about various deep learning techniques and neural networks. I also learnt about data visualization and statistical analysis.

- Later in the same year I worked as a deep learning intern at [HertzAI](https://www.hertzai.com/). Developed a hybrid AI based e-learning application using react native and Android also created assessment platform using django for conducting hiring and evaluation tests.

- I was more intrigued about AI semantics and natural language processing so I started learning about NLP. Started working with Semantics Research Group at [National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli](https://www.nitt.edu/). Here I worked on various NLP projects and published papers on various topics.
